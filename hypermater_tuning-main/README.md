# Hypermater tuning
This repo contains of code for hyperparameter tuning to improve the accuracy of machine learning models using Random Search, Grid Search, and HyperOpt optimization methods.
More info on how to implement can be found in my blog post [here](https://towardsdatascience.com/hyperparameter-tuning-for-machine-learning-models-1b80d783b946)
